# Chatbot_for_restaurant
Overview
The Interactive Restaurant Chatbot is an intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot designed to streamline restaurant ordering systems. Built using Dialogflow, Python (FastAPI), and MySQL, this chatbot facilitates both customer interactions through a web interface and backend operations for managing orders, intents, and entities.

This project enhances the restaurant ordering experience by automating order placements, answering common customer inquiries, and ensuring seamless integration with the backend database. This README provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and running the project.
